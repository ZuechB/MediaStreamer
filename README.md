# MediaStreamer
Rip Movies to your computer and stream to your Xbox one, another computer, and Windows IOT on your local network.

## Note
This project is a weekend project and does not follow any patterns or practices like most of my open source projects :) If you want to update it and help me our feel free.

## What does this fix?
I have a bunch of DVDs (especially kids movies) that I wanted to store on my old PC and have them streamed to my Xbox One. 

When the Xbox One came out streaming my media became a little more awkward. You couldn't just pick a movie like you could on the xbox 360 with media center extentions. This project is a simple setup to get around that as well as ripping the DVD itself to your local computer.

## Third Party Tools included
MAKEMKV - is used to Rips the disc

FFMPEG - is used to convert the MKV files to MP4 for UWP app

## Legal stuff
Please only rip discs that are your own. I am not responsible for anything illegal you attempt to do with this software. Please feel free to clone this project and change it in anyway that feels your need. I wrote this project to share with everyone!
