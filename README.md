# MediaStreamer
Rip Movies to your computer and stream to your Xbox one, another computer, and Windows IOT on your local network.

## What does this fix?
I have a bunch of DVDs (especially kids movies) that I wanted to store on my old PC and have them streamed to my Xbox One. 

## Third Party Tools included
MAKEMKV - is used to Rips the disc

FFMPEG - is used to convert the MKV files to MP4 for UWP app

## Legal stuff
Please only rip discs that are your own. I am not responsible for anything illegal you attempt to do with this software. Please feel free to clone this project and change it in anyway you want.
