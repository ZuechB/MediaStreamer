# MediaStreamer
Rip Movies to your computer and stream to your Xbox one, another computer, and Windows IOT on your local network

## What does this fix?
I have a bunch of DVDs (especially kids movies) that I wanted to store on my old PC and have them streamed to my Xbox One. 

When the Xbox One came out streaming my media became a little more awkward. You couldn't just pick a movie like you could on the xbox 360 with media center extentions. This project is a simple setup to get around that as well as ripping the DVD itself to your local computer.

## Third Party Tools included
MAKEMKV - is used to Rips the disc
FFMPEG - is used to convert the MKV files to MP4 for UWP app

## Legal stuff
Please do not rip movies that are not your own. I use this project as a way to backup my own media to my own computer to watch it on my own device on my own network. I am not responsible for anything you do or create with this project.
