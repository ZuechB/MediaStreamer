\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
\par}
{\pard  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
\par}
{\pard  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
\par}
{\pard  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
\par}
{\pard  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
\par}
{\pard  the version number 2.1.]
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard 			    Preamble
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
\par}
{\pard freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
\par}
{\pard Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
\par}
{\pard free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
\par}
{\pard specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
\par}
{\pard Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
\par}
{\pard can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
\par}
{\pard this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
\par}
{\pard strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
\par}
{\pard not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
\par}
{\pard you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
\par}
{\pard for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
\par}
{\pard it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
\par}
{\pard it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
\par}
{\pard these things.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
\par}
{\pard distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
\par}
{\pard rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
\par}
{\pard you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
\par}
{\pard or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
\par}
{\pard you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
\par}
{\pard code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
\par}
{\pard complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
\par}
{\pard with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
\par}
{\pard it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
\par}
{\pard library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
\par}
{\pard permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
\par}
{\pard there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
\par}
{\pard modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
\par}
{\pard that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
\par}
{\pard author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
\par}
{\pard introduced by others.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
\par}
{\pard any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
\par}
{\pard effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
\par}
{\pard restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
\par}
{\pard any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
\par}
{\pard consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
\par}
{\pard ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
\par}
{\pard General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
\par}
{\pard is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
\par}
{\pard this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
\par}
{\pard libraries into non-free programs.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
\par}
{\pard a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
\par}
{\pard combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
\par}
{\pard General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
\par}
{\pard entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
\par}
{\pard Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
\par}
{\pard the library.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
\par}
{\pard does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
\par}
{\pard Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
\par}
{\pard of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
\par}
{\pard are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
\par}
{\pard libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
\par}
{\pard special circumstances.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
\par}
{\pard encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
\par}
{\pard a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
\par}
{\pard allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
\par}
{\pard library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
\par}
{\pard case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
\par}
{\pard software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
\par}
{\pard programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
\par}
{\pard free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
\par}
{\pard non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
\par}
{\pard operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
\par}
{\pard system.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
\par}
{\pard users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
\par}
{\pard linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
\par}
{\pard that program using a modified version of the Library.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
\par}
{\pard modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
\par}
{\pard "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
\par}
{\pard former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
\par}
{\pard be combined with the library in order to run.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard 		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\par}
{\pard    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
\par}
{\pard program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
\par}
{\pard other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
\par}
{\pard this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
\par}
{\pard Each licensee is addressed as "you".
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
\par}
{\pard prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
\par}
{\pard (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
\par}
{\pard which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
\par}
{\pard Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
\par}
{\pard copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
\par}
{\pard portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
\par}
{\pard straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
\par}
{\pard included without limitation in the term "modification".)
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
\par}
{\pard making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
\par}
{\pard all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
\par}
{\pard interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
\par}
{\pard and installation of the library.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
\par}
{\pard covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
\par}
{\pard running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
\par}
{\pard such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
\par}
{\pard on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
\par}
{\pard writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
\par}
{\pard and what the program that uses the Library does.
\par}
{\pard   
\par}
{\pard   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
\par}
{\pard complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
\par}
{\pard you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
\par}
{\pard appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
\par}
{\pard all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
\par}
{\pard warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
\par}
{\pard Library.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
\par}
{\pard and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
\par}
{\pard fee.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
\par}
{\pard of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
\par}
{\pard distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
\par}
{\pard above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
\par}
{\pard     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
\par}
{\pard     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
\par}
{\pard     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
\par}
{\pard     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
\par}
{\pard     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
\par}
{\pard     in the event an application does not supply such function or
\par}
{\pard     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
\par}
{\pard     its purpose remains meaningful.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
\par}
{\pard     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
\par}
{\pard     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
\par}
{\pard     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
\par}
{\pard     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
\par}
{\pard     root function must still compute square roots.)
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
\par}
{\pard identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
\par}
{\pard and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
\par}
{\pard themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
\par}
{\pard sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
\par}
{\pard distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
\par}
{\pard on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
\par}
{\pard this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
\par}
{\pard entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
\par}
{\pard it.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
\par}
{\pard your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
\par}
{\pard exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
\par}
{\pard collective works based on the Library.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
\par}
{\pard with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
\par}
{\pard a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
\par}
{\pard the scope of this License.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
\par}
{\pard License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
\par}
{\pard this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
\par}
{\pard that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
\par}
{\pard instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
\par}
{\pard ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
\par}
{\pard that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
\par}
{\pard these notices.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
\par}
{\pard that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
\par}
{\pard subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
\par}
{\pard the Library into a program that is not a library.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
\par}
{\pard derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
\par}
{\pard under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
\par}
{\pard it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
\par}
{\pard must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
\par}
{\pard medium customarily used for software interchange.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
\par}
{\pard from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
\par}
{\pard source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
\par}
{\pard distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
\par}
{\pard compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
\par}
{\pard Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
\par}
{\pard linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
\par}
{\pard work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
\par}
{\pard therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
\par}
{\pard creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
\par}
{\pard contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
\par}
{\pard library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
\par}
{\pard Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
\par}
{\pard that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
\par}
{\pard derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
\par}
{\pard Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
\par}
{\pard linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
\par}
{\pard threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
\par}
{\pard structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
\par}
{\pard functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
\par}
{\pard file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
\par}
{\pard work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
\par}
{\pard Library will still fall under Section 6.)
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
\par}
{\pard distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
\par}
{\pard Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
\par}
{\pard whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
\par}
{\pard link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
\par}
{\pard work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
\par}
{\pard under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
\par}
{\pard modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
\par}
{\pard engineering for debugging such modifications.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
\par}
{\pard Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
\par}
{\pard this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
\par}
{\pard during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
\par}
{\pard copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
\par}
{\pard directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
\par}
{\pard of these things:
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
\par}
{\pard     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
\par}
{\pard     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
\par}
{\pard     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
\par}
{\pard     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
\par}
{\pard     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
\par}
{\pard     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
\par}
{\pard     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
\par}
{\pard     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
\par}
{\pard     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
\par}
{\pard     to use the modified definitions.)
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
\par}
{\pard     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
\par}
{\pard     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
\par}
{\pard     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
\par}
{\pard     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
\par}
{\pard     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
\par}
{\pard     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
\par}
{\pard     least three years, to give the same user the materials
\par}
{\pard     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
\par}
{\pard     than the cost of performing this distribution.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
\par}
{\pard     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
\par}
{\pard     specified materials from the same place.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
\par}
{\pard     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
\par}
{\pard Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
\par}
{\pard reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
\par}
{\pard the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
\par}
{\pard normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
\par}
{\pard components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
\par}
{\pard which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
\par}
{\pard the executable.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
\par}
{\pard restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
\par}
{\pard accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
\par}
{\pard use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
\par}
{\pard distribute.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
\par}
{\pard Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
\par}
{\pard facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
\par}
{\pard library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
\par}
{\pard the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
\par}
{\pard permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
\par}
{\pard     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
\par}
{\pard     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
\par}
{\pard     Sections above.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
\par}
{\pard     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
\par}
{\pard     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
\par}
{\pard the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
\par}
{\pard attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
\par}
{\pard distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
\par}
{\pard rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
\par}
{\pard or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
\par}
{\pard terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
\par}
{\pard signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
\par}
{\pard distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
\par}
{\pard prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
\par}
{\pard modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
\par}
{\pard Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
\par}
{\pard all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
\par}
{\pard the Library or works based on it.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
\par}
{\pard Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
\par}
{\pard original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
\par}
{\pard subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
\par}
{\pard restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
\par}
{\pard You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
\par}
{\pard this License.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
\par}
{\pard infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
\par}
{\pard conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
\par}
{\pard otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
\par}
{\pard excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
\par}
{\pard distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
\par}
{\pard License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
\par}
{\pard may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
\par}
{\pard license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
\par}
{\pard all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
\par}
{\pard the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
\par}
{\pard refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
\par}
{\pard particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
\par}
{\pard and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
\par}
{\pard patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
\par}
{\pard such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
\par}
{\pard integrity of the free software distribution system which is
\par}
{\pard implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
\par}
{\pard generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
\par}
{\pard through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
\par}
{\pard system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
\par}
{\pard to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
\par}
{\pard impose that choice.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
\par}
{\pard be a consequence of the rest of this License.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
\par}
{\pard certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
\par}
{\pard original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
\par}
{\pard an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
\par}
{\pard so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
\par}
{\pard excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
\par}
{\pard written in the body of this License.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
\par}
{\pard versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
\par}
{\pard Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
\par}
{\pard but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
\par}
{\pard specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
\par}
{\pard "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
\par}
{\pard conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
\par}
{\pard the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
\par}
{\pard license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
\par}
{\pard the Free Software Foundation.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
\par}
{\pard programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
\par}
{\pard write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
\par}
{\pard copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
\par}
{\pard Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
\par}
{\pard decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
\par}
{\pard of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
\par}
{\pard and reuse of software generally.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard 			    NO WARRANTY
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
\par}
{\pard WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
\par}
{\pard EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
\par}
{\pard OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
\par}
{\pard KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
\par}
{\pard IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
\par}
{\pard PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
\par}
{\pard LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
\par}
{\pard THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
\par}
{\pard WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
\par}
{\pard AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
\par}
{\pard FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
\par}
{\pard CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
\par}
{\pard LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
\par}
{\pard RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
\par}
{\pard FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
\par}
{\pard SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
\par}
{\pard DAMAGES.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
\par}
{\pard possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
\par}
{\pard everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
\par}
{\pard redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
\par}
{\pard ordinary General Public License).
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
\par}
{\pard safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
\par}
{\pard convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
\par}
{\pard "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

{\pard 1.    INTRODUCTION
\par}
{\pard The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android ("FDK AAC Codec") is software that implements
\par}
{\pard the MPEG Advanced Audio Coding ("AAC") encoding and decoding scheme for digital audio.
\par}
{\pard This FDK AAC Codec software is intended to be used on a wide variety of Android devices.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard AAC's HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 versions are regarded as today's most efficient general perceptual
\par}
{\pard audio codecs. AAC-ELD is considered the best-performing full-bandwidth communications codec by
\par}
{\pard independent studies and is widely deployed. AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part
\par}
{\pard of the MPEG specifications.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard Patent licenses for necessary patent claims for the FDK AAC Codec (including those of Fraunhofer)
\par}
{\pard may be obtained through Via Licensing (www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners
\par}
{\pard individually for the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant with
\par}
{\pard the ISO/IEC MPEG audio standards. Please note that most manufacturers of Android devices already license
\par}
{\pard these patent claims through Via Licensing or directly from the patent owners, and therefore FDK AAC Codec
\par}
{\pard software may already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those licensed purposes only.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard Commercially-licensed AAC software libraries, including floating-point versions with enhanced sound quality,
\par}
{\pard are also available from Fraunhofer. Users are encouraged to check the Fraunhofer website for additional
\par}
{\pard applications information and documentation.
\par}
{\pard

\par}
{\pard your modifications thereto in source code form.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard You must retain the complete text of this software license in the documentation and/or other materials
\par}
{\pard provided with redistributions of the FDK AAC Codec or your modifications thereto in binary form.
\par}
{\pard You must make available free of charge copies of the complete source code of the FDK AAC Codec and your
\par}
{\pard modifications thereto to recipients of copies in binary form.

{\pard You may not charge copyright license fees for anyone to use, copy or distribute the FDK AAC Codec
\par}
{\pard software or your modifications thereto.
\par}
{\pard 
\par}
{\pard Your modified versions of the FDK AAC Codec must carry prominent notices stating that you changed the software
\par}
{\pard and the date of any change. For modified versions of the FDK AAC Codec, the term
\par}
{\pard "Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android" must be replaced by the term
\par}
{\pard "Third-Party Modified Version of the Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android."
